# ReverseStringCheck-ShortestString
ReverseStringCheck
Compare two strings and check if they are
reversed. For instance, if the two strings are google and elgoog, then the method
returns 1. If the two strings are “data”, “ata” then the method returns 0.

ShortestString
Takes a set of strings. Then, for every
three consecutive strings (assuming the list of strings is larger than 3) leave
only the shorter of the three.
